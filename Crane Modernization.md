ยง2. Section 3302.1 of the New York city building code is amended by adding a new definition for "MANUFACTURE DATE (Crane)," in appropriate alphabetical order, to read as follows:
MANUFACTURE DATE (Crane). For a particular crane, the earlier of the following dates:

Exceptions:
 
1.      A crane with an age of 25 years or greater from the manufacture date that is (i) in use on a project on October 1, 2014 or (ii) not in use on October 1, 2014, but for which an application for a certificate of on-site inspection has been approved as of October 1, 2014, may continue to be used until completion of the project for which it is being used or the project for which such certificate of onsite inspection was issued.
 
2.      Where a crane with an age of less than 25 years from the manufacture date at the time the department approved the application for a certificate of on-site inspection is being used on a project and will reach an age of 25 years or greater from the manufacture date during such project, such crane may be used for the duration of that project or until it reaches 28 years of age, whichever occurs earlier.
 
3.      The commissioner may approve the use of a crane with an age of 25 years or greater from the manufacture date for up to a maximum of five years, not to exceed 30 years from the manufacture date, when load cycle counter logs and other records as required by rule of the department are deemed sufficient by the commissioner to establish that such crane meets the manufacturer's standards for use.
 
3319.12 Load cycle counters. Each crane shall be equipped with a load cycle counter. The owner of such crane shall maintain accurate records of the cycles that the crane performs.

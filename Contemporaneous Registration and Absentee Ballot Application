Int. No. 536

By Council Members Kallos, Chin, Constantinides, Johnson and Espinal

A Local Law to amend the New York city charter, in relation to contemporaneous registration and absentee ballot application.

Be it enacted by the Council as follows:

Section 1. Chapter 46 of the New York city charter is amended by adding a new section 1057-c to read as follows:

§ 1057-c Contemporaneous Registration and Absentee Ballot Application.

Notwithstanding any inconsistent provisions of the election law, any qualified person who is not registered to vote in the city of New York, and who, if he or she were registered, would be eligible to apply to vote by absentee ballot shall be deemed registered to vote for the purposes of applying to vote by absentee ballot if such voter submits a completed registration form that is timely for the purposes of voting on the date of the election or elections for which he or she is applying for an absentee ballot. The absentee ballot application form used by the New York city board of elections shall not require an applicant to affirm that they are “a qualified and registered voter,” but shall instead require a statement that they are “a qualified voter who is either registered or has submitted a timely registration for the election or elections for which I am requesting an absentee ballot.” An absentee ballot cast by a voter who receives such a ballot pursuant to this section shall be a valid vote if the New York city board of elections determines, upon reviewing such voter’s submitted registration form, that such registration is valid for the purposes of voting on the date of such election.

§2. This local law shall take effect one hundred eight days following its enactment into law.

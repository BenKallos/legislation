e. The home page and, to the extent one exists, the “contact us” or “freedom of information request” page of the website of every agency shall include a link to the portal developed and maintained pursuant to subdivision b of this section.
f. Every agency shall use the portal developed and maintained pursuant to subdivision b of this section to receive and respond to requests unless otherwise requested by an individual or entity making a request. Upon receipt of any request by means other than the portal, the receiving agency shall enter the request into such portal, and shall track the progress of such request as required by subdivision c of this section.
§3.

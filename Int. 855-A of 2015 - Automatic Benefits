Be it enacted by the Council as follows:
 
Section 1. Chapter 1 of title 21 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 21-138 to read as follows:

§ 21-138 Notification of public assistance eligibility 

a. Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:

  Notice. The term “notice” means a written communication sent through the mail or, with the consent of an individual, through electronic means with the ability to track and confirm delivery.

  Public assistance. The term “public assistance” means all forms of public benefits provided by the federal government, state of New York, or city of New York that an individual may apply for through the department including but not limited to: cash assistance; the home energy assistance program; medicaid; and the supplemental nutrition assistance program.

  Renewal. The term “renewal” means the automatic or affirmative act of recertifying or re-applying for public assistance, as may be required on a periodic basis, for an individual already receiving such public assistance.

b. For every individual who submits an application for a public assistance, or is in receipt of public assistance, the department shall determine other forms of public assistance for which the individual may qualify based on the individual’s public assistance application, and the department shall provide the individual with the following:

  1. Notice of any additional public assistance for which the individual may qualify. Such notice shall include a copy of the applicable applications and instructions on how to apply for such public assistance.

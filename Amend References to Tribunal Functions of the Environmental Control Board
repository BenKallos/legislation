The owner, net lessee or person in charge of any residential building of nine or more dwelling units or a commercial, manufacturing or industrial building with respect to which four or more violations were committed on different days within a period of six months shall be classified as a persistent violator.

Before issuing any such notices of violation to a persistent violator on a per bag or per container basis, the commissioner shall give such violator a reasonable opportunity to correct the condition constituting the violation.

4. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the number of dwelling units designated on a notice of violation issued pursuant to this section reflects the number of dwelling units in the residential building for which the notice of violation was issued. Where such presumption is rebutted, the number of dwelling units on such notice of violation shall be deemed modified accordingly, and in no event shall such notice of violation be dismissed solely on the ground that the number of dwelling units on the original notice of violation was incorrectly stated.

5. The commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall establish a recycling training program for owners or employees of residential buildings of nine or more dwelling units for which at least three notices of violation for failing to properly source separate designated recyclable material have been issued within a twelve-month period and which the commissioner determines to be in need of recycling training. Such training program shall require the building owner, or an employee who is primarily responsible for waste disposal and/or janitorial services for any such building, to attend a training program established by the commissioner or the commissioner's designee designed to improve recycling practices at such building and a fee may be imposed on any owner or employee who participates in such training program.

 ________________________________________________________________________

Each day during which such violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. The board or an authorized tribunal of the office of administrative trials and hearings may remit, in whole or in part, such a civil penalty if, at the conclusion of the hearing or at the time of the board determination or determination of an authorized tribunal of the office of administrative trials and hearings under section 24-266 of this code, the respondent is no longer in violation of a provision of this code, or of any order, rule or regulation promulgated by the commissioner or the board or an authorized tribunal of the office of administrative trials and hearings;

(10) Order any person to be classified as a persistent violator if such person is found to be in violation of this code and has also on one or more prior occasions within the preceding five years been found to be in violation of this code, where such repeated violations evidence [substantial] substantial disregard thereof. If a person is classified as a persistent violator, the board or an authorized tribunal of the office of administrative trials and hearings shall in each instance double the amount of the penalty which it would otherwise impose pursuant to paragraph five of this subdivision.
